## Motivation
HyperExpress aims to be a simple yet perfomant HTTP & Websocket Server. Combined with the power of uWebsockets.js, a Node.js binding of uSockets written in C++, HyperExpress allows developers to unlock higher throughput for their web applications with their existing hardware. This can allow many web applications to become much more performant on optimized data serving endpoints without having to scale hardware.

Some of the prominent features implemented are:
- Simplified HTTP & Websocket API
- Global & Route-Specific Middlewares Support
- Modular Routers Support
- Server-Sent Events Support
- HTTP & Websocket Streaming Support
- Performant Multipart File Uploading
- Global Error/Event Handlers
- Cryptographically Secure Cookie Signing/Authentication
- ExpressJS API Compatibility Through Shared Methods/Properties
- TypeScript Types Support

See [`> [Benchmarks]`](./docs/Benchmarks.md) for **performance metrics** against other webservers in real world deployments.

## Documentation
HyperExpress requires Node.js version 14+ and can be installed using Node Package Manager (`npm`).
```
npm i hyper-express
```

- See [`> [Examples & Snippets]`](./docs/Examples.md) for small and **easy-to-use snippets** with HyperExpress.
- See [`> [Server]`](./docs/Server.md) for creating a webserver and working with the **Server** component.
- See [`> [Middlewares]`](./docs/Middlewares.md) for working with global and route-specific **Middlewares** in HyperExpress.
- See [`> [Router]`](./docs/Router.md) for working with the modular **Router** component.
- See [`> [Request]`](./docs/Request.md) for working with the **Request** component made available through handlers.
- See [`> [Response]`](./docs/Response.md) for working with the **Response** component made available through handlers.
- See [`> [MultipartField]`](./docs/MultipartField.md) for working with multipart requests and **File Uploading** in HyperExpress.
- See [`> [SSEventStream]`](./docs/SSEventStream.md) for working with **Server-Sent Events** based streaming in HyperExpress.
- See [`> [Websocket]`](./docs/Websocket.md) for working with **Websockets** in HyperExpress.
- See [`> [SessionEngine]`](https://github.com/kartikk221/hyper-express-session) for working with cookie based web **Sessions** in HyperExpress.
- See [`> [LiveDirectory]`](./docs/LiveDirectory.md) for implementing **static file/asset** serving functionality into HyperExpress.

## What's Different?
While there may be other uWebsockets.js based packages available, HyperExpress differentiates itself in the following ways:
- Instantaneous Request Handling
    - HyperExpress implements a request handling model similar to fetch where a request is passed almost instantly to the route handler and the request body can be asynchronously dowloaded/accessed. This behavior allows for aborting of a request and potentially saving on memory usage for endpoints that deal with relatively larger body sizes as the body simply won't be downloaded into memory without access.
- High Maintainability
    - Whether you decide to develop on your own fork or expand upon HyperExpress through middlewares, You will be greeted with a concise codebase with descriptive logic comments, JSDoc and Typescript types allowing for high maintainability.
- Lightweight Package Size
    - HyperExpress is extremely lightweight while implementing almost all of the core functionalities of a webserver providing users with flexibility.

## Testing Changes
To run HyperExpress functionality tests locally on your machine, you must follow the steps below.
1. Clone the HyperExpress repository to your machine.
2. Initialize and pull any submodule(s) which are used throughout the tests.
3. Run `npm install` in the root of the HyperExpress repository.
4. Run `npm install` in the `/tests` directory.
5. Execute the `/tests/index.js` file to perform tests.
